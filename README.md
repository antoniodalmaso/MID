# MID
This repository contains all the code related to the development and the testing of the Minimum Impurity Discretizer algorithm. This is a new discretization technique developed to improve the capabilities of Optimal Decision Tree (ODT) learners when applied on continuous datasets. This technique has been developed specifically to be used together with [DL8.5](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5711).

The python implementation of the discretizer can be found inside discretizers/MinimumImpurityDiscretizer.py.

## CREDITS
The implementation of the MDLP discretization technique used as a comparison for MID is the one developed by Victor Ruiz (vmr11@pitt.edu). The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/navicto/Discretization-MDLPC.git).
